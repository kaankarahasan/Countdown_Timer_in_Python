# Countdown_Timer_in_Python
This Python project implements a simple countdown timer. The user inputs a time in seconds, and the program counts down, displaying the remaining time in hours, minutes, and seconds (HH.MM.SS format). Once the countdown reaches zero, the program displays the message "TIME'S UP!".
